A Max "instrument" that allows controlled playback and editing of several repeating audio segments

This project was made for Northwestern's MUSIC_TECH 345: Tech Based Performance. It's built for an environment where you are taking input from other Max instruments and passing your output to someone else or the mixing board for instrument jams.
